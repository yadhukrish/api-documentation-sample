# Technical Writing Portfolio: API Documentation

## Overview
This project serves as a technical writing sample for the OpenWeather API. It demonstrates my ability to document RESTful endpoints, authentication workflows, and JSON response schemas.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Docs-as-Code:** Writing documentation in Markdown and managing it via GitHub.
* **API Testing:** Verified endpoint behavior and error codes using Postman.
* **Technical Accuracy:** Mapping complex JSON responses to human-readable definitions.

## Project Structure
* [OpenWeather API Guide](./openweather-api-guide.md): The core documentation for the Current Weather endpoint.
