# Technical Writing Portfolio: API Documentation Sample

## Project Overview
This repository contains a technical documentation sample for the OpenWeather Current Weather API. It serves as a demonstration of technical writing capabilities, specifically focused on RESTful API documentation, Markdown-based workflows, and developer-centric communication.

## Professional Context
I am a Senior QA Engineer with over 7 years of experience in software quality and systems analysis. This documentation was developed to bridge the gap between technical testing and user-centric documentation, utilizing a Quality First approach to ensure technical accuracy and comprehensive error coverage.

## Skills Demonstrated
* **Docs-as-Code:** Authoring and managing documentation via GitHub and Markdown.
* **API Analysis:** Translating JSON response schemas into human-readable field definitions.
* **Technical Testing:** Using Postman to verify endpoint behavior, status codes, and data types.
* **Information Architecture:** Organizing complex technical data into scannable, logical structures.

## Repository Contents
* **[Current Weather API Guide](./openweather-api-guide.md):** The primary documentation for the Current Weather endpoint, including authentication, parameters, and JSON schemas.
* **[Error Handling](./openweather-api-guide.md#error-handling):** A categorized guide for troubleshooting failed API requests based on HTTP status codes.

## Tools Used
* **Markdown:** For structured documentation.
* **Postman:** For API endpoint verification.
* **GitHub:** For version control and hosting.
* **cURL:** For standardizing request examples.
